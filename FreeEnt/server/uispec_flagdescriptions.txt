[@O]
You may add additional objectives to the game; they can be viewed in-game from the Track menu.

[Omode:classicforge]
Bring the Adamant and Legend Sword to Kokkol to complete this objective. In this mode, you will not receive the Excalibur from Kokkol; instead the Excalibur replaces the Crystal in the pool of key items. This mode forces the <em>Owin:crystal</em> flag to be on.

[@Orandompool2]
An additinal pool of random objectives, enabling both more random objectives and different allowed types. <a href="/fork_info#objective-pools" class="nf nf-md-information"></a>

[@Orandompool3]
An additinal pool of random objectives, enabling both more random objectives and different allowed types. <a href="/fork_info#objective-pools" class="nf nf-md-information"></a>

[@Ogated]
A gated objective means that you will only get the reward for that objective upon completion of all required other objectives.  So if you set "Complete the Tower of Zot" as a gated objective, you will be granted the earth crystal automatically upon completion of the other objectives. <a href="/fork_info#objectives-gated" class="nf nf-md-information"></a>

[@Ohardreq]
Hard required objectives are a # of objectives that must be completed in order to consider all objectives completed.  So if you require 4 out of 5 objectives, and 1 hard required, the hard objective must be included as part of the 4. <a href="/fork_info#objectives-required" class="nf nf-md-information"></a>

[@Ocustom]
<ul>
    <li>Duplicate objectives will be omitted.</li>
    <li>A character objective is met when the requirements to gain the character have been fulfilled; you do not need to actually add them to your party.</li>
    <li>Starting characters do not count towards character objectives.</li>
    <li>Setting the Pass quest objective with no other P flags will force Pkey to be enabled.</li>
</ul>

[Kmain]
The locations of key items are shuffled amongst each other. For example, you may find the Magma Key in the Antlion's Nest instead of the Sandruby.

The items randomized this way are the <em>Package, SandRuby, Legend Sword, Baron Key, TwinHarp, Earth Crystal, Magma Key, Tower Key, Airship Hook, Luca Key, Dark Crystal, Pink Tail, Rat Tail, Pan, Spoon, Adamant,</em> and the <em>Crystal used to transform Zeromus</em> (yes, you have to find it.)

[Ksummon]
Key items may be awarded by the Sylphs, the king and queen of the Feymarch, Odin's throne, and Cave Bahamut.

[Kmoon]
Key items may be awarded by the bosses of the Lunar Subterrane.

[Kmiab:standard]
This excludes monster-in-a-box chests in the Lunar Subterrane, unless also using Kmoon or Kunsafe.

[Klstmiab]
This ignores the Kmoon or Kunsafe safety check that Kmiab has.

[Kforge]
The reward for turning in the Legend Sword and Adamant to Kokkol is a key item. The vanilla Excalibur is added to the key items rewards pool. If the hero challenge is enabled, this overrides the normal <em>Chero</em> supersmith reward.

[Kpink]
The reward for trading away the Pink Tail is a key item. The vanilla Adamant Armor is added to the key item rewards pool unless adamant armors are disabled via <em>-noadamants</em>.

[Klstmiab]
This ignores the Kmoon or Kunsafe safety check that Kmiab has.

[Kmiab:all]
All monster-in-a-box chests are included, regardless of any Kmoon or Kunsafe settings.

[Kmiab:above]
Includes the monster-in-a-box chests in Zot, Castle Eblan, Cave Eblan, Upper Bab-il, the Giant of Bab-il, and the Lunar Path.

[Kmiab:below]
Includes the monster-in-a-box chests in Lower Bab-il, Sylph Cave, and the Feymarch.

[Kmiab:lst]
Includes the monster-in-a-box chests in the Lunar Subterrane. This setting ignores the Kmoon or Kunsafe safety check.

[Knofree]
Edward in Toroia will not give you a key item. Instead, a key item may be earned from Rydia's mom in Mist, who will appear after you have found and defeated the Mist Dragon.

[Knofree:dwarf]
Edward in Toroia will not give you a key item. Instead, a key item may be earned from talking to Cid in the Dwarf Castle hospital. 

[Knofree:package]
Edward in Toroia will not give you a key item. Instead, a key item may be earned from Rydia's mom in Mist, who will appear after you have used the Package to burn Mist Village. 

[Kforce:magma]
You are guaranteed that there is a path to the underworld via the Magma Key, without needing to use the Hook route through Cave Eblan.

[Kforce:hook]
You are guaranteed that the Hook route through Cave Eblan is the only way to access the underworld.

[Kunsafe]
<ul>
    <li>Normally, you are guaranteed a path to the underworld that does not require first going to the moon. This flag removes that check.</li>
    <li>If Kmiab is enabled, key items may appear in the Lunar Subterrane monster-in-a-box chests.</li>
</ul>

[Kunweighted]
Normally, key-item-enabled locations outside of the <em>Kmain</em> checks are weighted against in terms of placement. This flag removes that weighting. 

[Kunsafer]
As Kunsafe, but you will be <em>required</em> to obtain moon access prior to obtaining underground access.

[Klatedark]
The Darkness Crystal will be gated by underground access.

[Pchests]
Passes are placed in three random treasure chests (not on the moon).

[Cstandard]
Characters join your party in the same locations as the original game, but the character you meet there is randomized. For example, you may encounter Yang in the Watery Pass instead of Tellah. The randomizer will try to prevent more powerful characters (Fusoya and Edge, by default) from appearing in early-game positions.

[Crelaxed]
Characters join your party in the same locations as the original game, but the character you meet there is randomized. For example, you may encounter Yang in the Watery Pass instead of Tellah. Unlike the standard randomization, characters are equally likely to appear in any position.

[Cnofree]
Characters will not join your party in the Watery Pass, Damcyan, Mysidia, or Mt. Ordeals.

[Cnoearned]
Characters will not join your party in Kaipo, Mt. Hobs, Baron, Zot, the Dwarf Castle, Cave Eblan, the Lunar Palace, or the Giant of Bab-il.

[Cnopartner]
Your starting partner will not join your party. <a href="/fork_info#nopartner" class="nf nf-md-information"></a>

[Cpaladin]
Cecil will start as a paladin, but Mt. Ordeals will still grant spells to Tellah, and hold a key item check. <a href="/fork_info#cpaladin" class="nf nf-md-information"></a>

[Cmaybe]
Normally, the randomizer will try to include every eligible character in the game at least once. This flag removes that logic, meaning some eligible characters may not appear.

[Ctreasure:free]
Free characters will instead be found in treasure chests in the overworld. Restricted characters will be found in MIABs. <a href="/fork_info#ctreasure-free" class="nf nf-md-information"></a>

[Ctreasure:earned]
Earned characters will instead be found in treasure chests in the overworld. Restricted characters will be found in MIABs. <a href="/fork_info#ctreasure-earned" class="nf nf-md-information"></a>

[Ctreasure:unsafe]
Free characters will normally all be placed in treasures in the overworld only.  With this flag however, characters will be distributed throughout the underworld,overworld and moon.  This means you may end up with no characters in chests in the overworld. <a href="/fork_info#ctreasure-unsafe" class="nf nf-md-information"></a>

[Ctreasure:relaxed]
Restricted characters will be found in all chests.  No characters will be placed in MIAB chests. <a href="/fork_info#ctreasure-relaxed" class="nf nf-md-information"></a>

[@CrestrictDefine]
Under standard settings, the randomizer considers Fusoya and Edge to be "restricted" characters due to their power level, and will try to place them in later-game positions. You may redefine which characters are considered "restricted" here.

[@CstartDefine]
Your starting character will be chosen among the options selected here, regardless of other flag settings.

[@CstartModify]
Your starting character will be selected as normal according to your other flag settings, modified by the options selected here.

[Cj:spells]
White mages will learn Armor, Shell, and Dispel. All mages learn spells at the levels they would in FF4j.

[Cj:abilities]
Characters retain the battle commands from FF4j that were removed in FF4us.

[Cnodupes]
If a duplicate character tries to join your party, instead nothing happens.

[Cnekkie]
Characters start with a random low-level weapon and no armor. (Duplicate characters will have the same starting gear.)

[@Cthrifttier]
Characters start with a full set of gear: weapon(s), possibly a shield, and head/body/arms, all from at most the tier specified. (Duplicate characters will have the same starting gear. Cursed Rings are excluded.)

[Chi]
New characters are required to join the party, even if your party is full.

[Cbye]
Dismissed characters cannot be retrieved. (Normally, dismissed characters go to the Mysidia crystal room and the Tower of Wishes where they may be reclaimed.)

[Cfifo]
When dismissing a character, you must dismiss the character that has been in your party the longest.

[Cpermajoin]
You have the choice of whether to accept each new party member, but once your party is full, you cannot recruit anyone else.

[Cpermadeath]
Party members that are "swoon" at the end of any battle are permanently removed from the game. (Does not apply to cutscene/story battles you are allowed to lose, ie. Dark Elf first round or Titan fight at Mist.)

[Cpermadeader]
Party members that are swoon or stone at the end of any battle are permanently removed from the game. (This includes the cutscene/story battles that you are normally allowed to lose; now you will game over if your party wipes during these battles.)

[Chero]
- The starting character is your hero.
- The hero is the only instance of that character available (unless other flags force it).
- The hero cannot be dismissed.
- The hero fights the Mt. Ordeals mirror room boss alone.
- Kokkol will craft an FF4 Advance weapon usable by the hero (unless forge is set to give a key item via <em>Kforge</em>).
- The hero gains EXP even if incapacitated.
- The hero is your agility anchor.
- The hero is exempt from permadeath.

[Csuperhero]
- This flag acts the same as Chero, except your starting character will obtain incredible stat boosts, until finding the earth crystal (their one weakness).  Once returning the crystal to Zot, you gain your powers back. <a href="/fork_info#superhero" class="nf nf-md-information"></a>

[Tshuffle]
Treasure contents are the same as in original FF4, but their positions are shuffled. This randomization is weighted so that overworld treasures tend to remain in the overworld, and similarly for underworld/moon treasures.

[Tstandard]
A basic randomization, allowing items of reasonable strength to appear. Items are equally likely to appear in any chest regardless of location.

[Tpro]
A skill-testing randomization, limiting the strength of available items, and weighted to favor stronger items in later-game and infrequently-visited areas.

[Twild]
An unrestricted randomization, allowing equal chance for items to appear in any chest, including the most powerful items.

[Twildish]
Allows items of any strength to appear, including the most powerful items, but uses location-based weighting like the pro randomization.

[Tplayable]
Equipment in chests (including MIABs) will be usable by at least one character that you can acquire in the seed.

[Tsemipro]
Uses location-based weighting, with item quality between that provided by pro and wildish.

[Tvanillaish]
Uses location-based weighting, with item quality approximately that of the vanilla game.

[Tjunk]
Normally, poor-quality items in chests are replaced with an equivalent amount of GP (based on sell price) to reduce inventory bloat. Enable this flag if you want to keep them as items.

[Tmoney]
Instead of their assigned contents, all chests contain an equivalent amount of GP, based on sell price (monster-in-a-box chests excluded).

[Tsparsey:underground]
The Tsparse flags will only affect chests in the underground

[Tsparsey:moon]
The Tsparse flags will only affect chests in the moon

[Tsparsey:overworld]
The Tsparse flags will only affect chests in the overworld

[Sshuffle]
The same items are available for sale in shops as in original FF4, but their locations are shuffled. This randomization is weighted so that overworld shop items tend to remain on the overworld, and similarly for underworld/moon shops.

[Sstandard]
A basic randomization, allowing items of moderate strength to appear in shops, and weighted to place stronger items in later-game shops.

[Spro]
A skill-testing randomization, limiting the strength of available items, and weighted to place stronger items in shops gated behind key items.

[Swild]
An unrestricted randomization, allowing equal chance for items to appear in any shop, including the most powerful items.

[Ssame]
Shops only sell a single item, and all shops in the game are the same.  The item chosen uses the same rules as Swild.

[Ssingles]
Shops only sell a single item, but follow the standard randomization rules and safety checks (unless disabled).

[Swildish]
A basic randomization, allowing slightly stronger items than the standard randomization to place in shops.

[Svanillaish]
Shops will contain items of similar quality and quantity as their vanilla counterparts.

[Sunsafe]
Normally, the randomizer guarantees Cure2 potions, Life potions and StarVeils are readily available, and that Cure3 potions are available in seeds without white mages. This flag removes those checks.

[Bstandard]
The positions of bosses are shuffled. Boss stats are roughly scaled to match the battle it's replacing. For example, Rubicant in the Watery Pass would have the HP and speed of Octomamm. (Yes, this flag is janky, and a MegaNuke is still a MegaNuke. Save often.)

[Bunsafe]
Normally, you are guaranteed a path to the underworld that does not require defeating the most difficult bosses. This flag removes that check.

[Bnofree]
All boss battle enemies have the "boss bit" set.  The alternate win conditions are removed from the D.Knight, Karate, K/Q.Eblan, and WaterHag fights.

[Balt:gauntlet]
Replaces the Fabul Gauntlet boss with five unscaled normal enemy encounters from the nearby area.

[@Brestrict]
Limits the locations that bosses specified in objectives can appear in. If Knofree is enabled, this will include D.Mist.

[Bwhichburn]
The replacement attack will be weaker than MegaNuke (unless <em>Bunsafe</em> is enabled, in which case it may not be).

[Bitburns]
The replacement attack will include Meganuke, Big Bang, Zanteksuken, Full party charm, and Meteo

[Bwoahdin]
The replacement attack will be single-target (and generally weaker than e.g. Nuke, unless <em>Bunsafe</em> is enabled). Odin will not raise the sword before the random attack.

[Bwhybez]
Golbez does not use HoldGas or summon Shadow; he will immediately start cycling through his three available spells.

[Bwhichbez]
Each of Shadow's and Golbez's spells are replaced individually. If <em>Bunsafe</em> is enabled, Golbez has access to more powerful spells.

[@G]
The glitches explicitly referenced here are <em>disabled by default</em>; setting these flags enables them to act as they do in original FF4. Glitches not mentioned here remain intact and available.

[Gsylph]
When enabled, casting Sylph will only deduct MP from the caster if they are in the middle party slot.

[Etoggle]
Encounters can be enabled/disabled from the in-game Custom menu.

[Ekeep:doors]
Prevents the above encounter rate setting from applying to the TrapDoor fights in the Sealed Cave.

[Ekeep:behemoths]
Prevents the above encounter rate setting from applying to the forced Behemoth fights in Cave Bahamut.

[Edanger]
Back attacks and "Surprised!" encounters will still occur, even when encounters are disabled via <em>Etoggle</em> or <em>Enoencounters</em>.

[Enoexp]
Bosses and monster-in-a-box fights still award EXP.

[Enodmachin]
The D.Machin in the Searcher encounter is replaced by a Horseman.

5-10 Exits

[-kit3:random]
One of the other kit options, selected at random.

[-noadamants]
Adamant Armors are not available. Trading the Pink Tail in the Adamant Grotto instead grants a strong item.

[-monsterevade]
Monsters will be able to evade both physical and magical attacks from your party based on their actual stats. (This change constitutes a significant damage reduction for many fights!)

[-monsterflee]
Monsters will be able to flee from battles that you can run from, based on their evasion stat. Requires <em>-monsterevade</em> to be active.

[@smithy]
Normally, Kokkol the Smith forges the Adamant and Legend to make Excalibur. These flags change what Kokkol will make.

[-smith:super]
Instead of the Excalibur, Kokkol the Smith will forge a weapon from Final Fantasy 4 Advance. (Some weapons have been modified slightly due to technical limitations.)

[-smith:playable]
The item that Kokkol forges will be usable by a character you can acquire in the seed.

[@fusoya] 
By default, Free Enterprise runs with the "FuSoYa Challenge", where FuSoYa begins with 500 HP and a collection of low-level spells, and each boss defeated grants him 100 HP and three random additional spells. This behaviour may be changed using these flags.

[-fusoya:vanilla] 
Restore the vanilla game's FuSoYa behaviour, where he joins with 1900 HP and his full spellset.

[-fusoya:sequential_p] 
Instead of learning spells randomly, FuSoYa will learn spells in order based on the levels at which Palom and Porom learn their spells.

[-fusoya:sequential_r] 
Instead of learning spells randomly, FuSoYa will learn spells in order based on the levels at which Rydia and Rosa learn their spells. He will not learn spells learned outside of level-ups (Fire1, Fire2/Ice2/Lit2, Exit).

[-fusoya:location] 
FuSoYa will learn three spells after every boss, but the spells learned depend on the boss location. Stronger/gated boss spots are weighted to provide more powerful spells.

[-fusoya:nerfed] 
FuSoYa will start with a fixed pool of 14 black magic and 14 white magic spells (17 with j-spells), mostly tier 2 and below, but will not learn any spells over the course of the game. He will still gain HP as usual.

[-fusoya:maybe] 
Normally, FuSoYa will eventually learn all possible spells. This flag removes that guarantee; each possible spell will be included independently with an 85% chance.

[-vintage]
Enables the April Fools Day 2019 mode.

[-doorsrando]
Randomizes most doors in the game (including houses, etc).
<ul>
    <li>Normal=Doors of each world (Overworld, Underworld, Moon) are shuffled independently</li>
    <li>Blue Planet=Doors of the Overworld and Underworld are shuffled together and the Moon is shuffled independently.</li>
    <li>Gated=Doors of the Moon and Underworld are shuffled together and the Overworld is shuffled independently.</li>
    <li>Why=Doors of the Moon and Overworld are shuffled together and the Underworld is shuffled independently.</li>
    <li>All=Doors of each world (Overworld, Underworld, Moon) are shuffled together.</li>
</ul>

[-entrancesrando]
Randomizes most Entrances in the game. Doors inside towns remain intact.
<ul>
    <li>Normal=Doors of each world (Overworld, Underworld, Moon) are shuffled independently</li>
    <li>Blue Planet=Doors of the Overworld and Underworld are shuffled together and the Moon is shuffled independently.</li>
    <li>Gated=Doors of the Moon and Underworld are shuffled together and the Overworld is shuffled independently.</li>
    <li>Why=Doors of the Moon and Overworld are shuffled together and the Underworld is shuffled independently.</li>
    <li>All=Doors of each world (Overworld, Underworld, Moon) are shuffled together.</li>
</ul>

[-calmness]
Disables the use of the Panic button (Select + R)

[-forcesealed]
Fighting the Sealed Cave boss is required before seeing the KI

[-pushbtojump]
<ul>
    <li>Enables the April Fools Day 2020 mode.</li>
    <li>This flag does not affect the randomized placement of progression items.</li>
    <li>Stability is absolutely not guaranteed.</li>
    <li>Instability is absolutely guaranteed.</li>
    <li>(If a door goes somewhere you don't expect it to go, it was probably a "return" door, which takes you back to your previous location.)</li>
</ul>

[-vanilla:agility]
FF4 scales the speed of combat based on the agility stat of your party's "agility anchor". In Free Enterprise, the anchor is always the first occupied party slot (in the sequence of middle, top, bottom, top-middle, bottom-middle). However, in vanilla FF4, if Cecil is in the party, then he is the agility anchor, regardless of position. Enabling this flag will restore that behavior, making the first Cecil in your party the anchor, if present. (Note that this overrides the <em>Chero</em> agility effect, if playing with the hero challenge.)

[-vanilla:hobs]
By default, instead of learning Fire1 at Mt. Hobs, Rydia will learn a random summon (other than Leviatan and Bahamut). This flag removes that behavior.

[@exp]
To reduce grinding, Free Enterprise normally applies a number of experience boosts, which may be individually disabled by these flags. There are also options to change the experience distribution in other ways.

[-exp:split]
Normally in Free Enterprise, earned EXP is not divided among the party, and each member receives the full amount. Set this flag to restore the original FF4 EXP distribution scheme (ie. earned EXP is divided among the surviving party members).

[-exp:noboost]
Normally in Free Enterprise, in a full party, low-level party members (at least 5 levels below the median level) earn double EXP. Set this flag to remove this bonus.

[-exp:nokeybonus]
By default in Free Enterprise, once 10 key items have been collected, earned EXP is doubled. Set this flag to remove this bonus.

[-exp:kicheckbonus]
Normally, objectives do not increase the amount of EXP received from battles. Under this flag, each key item location checked earns you 12.5% more EXP from each battle.

[-exp:crystalbonus]
Under this flag, characters earn double EXP once you obtain the Crystal.

[@objectiveexp]
Normally, objectives do not increase the amount of EXP received from battles. Under this flag, each completed objective earns you more EXP from each battle.

[-exp:objectivebonus_num]
The EXP bonus is 100% divided by the number of available objectives in the seed; e.g. with 7 objectives, each objective gives you about 14% extra EXP (subject to some truncation).

[@kicheckexp]
Normally, completing key item checks does not increase the amount of EXP received from battles. Under this flag, each completed key item check beyond the starting item earns you more EXP from each battle.

[-exp:kicheckbonus_num]
The EXP bonus is 100% divided by the number of potential key item checks in the seed; e.g. with the 21 non-starting main and summon checks on, each objective gives you about 4.7% extra EXP (subject to some truncation).

[@zonkbonusexp]
Normally, the rewards from key item checks do not impact the amount of EXP received from battles. Under this flag, every time you get a non-key-item reward from a potential key item check (a "zonk") you earn more EXP from future battles.

[@miabbonusexp]
Normally, MIAB encounters have the same EXP calculation as other encounters. Under this flag, MIAB encounters award double or 1.5 times the usual EXP.

[@moonbonusexp]
Normally, location of encounter does not increase EXP. Under this flag, encounters on the moon award double or triple the usual EXP.

[-exp:maxlevelbonus]
Normally, level does not play into EXP calculations. Under this flag, if 5 plus twice the largest level in your party is less than the smallest monster level in the encounter, then the encounter awards 20% bonus EXP (and another 20% for each additional deficit of 5).

[@geometricexp]
Normally in FF4, each instance of a monster type killed in battle gives the same amount of EXP. Under this flag, each monster of the same type defeated in the same battle will yield a scaled amount of the EXP of the previous monster of that type, giving diminishing returns for repeated monster kills. Note that the reduction is per monster type and not "per slot" in battle.

[-vanilla:growup]
By default in Free Enterprise, the summons learned when Rydia ages are randomized. Set this flag to return to the vanilla summons learned at that time (Mist, Indra, Jinn, Shiva, and Titan).

[-vanilla:fashion]
To help distinguish duplicate characters, Free Enterprise randomizes the battle palettes of each character. Enabling this flag preserves each character's original battle colors.

[-vanilla:miabs]
By default, monster-in-a-box chests are relocated randomly within the same dungeon/area. This flag forces MIABs to remain in their original positions.

[-vanilla:giant]
Removes the added exit at the start of the Giant of Bab-il, forcing you to complete it in order to return to the Big Whale. (Be careful not to get stuck with your only save file being inside the Giant.) This exit is restored once the Giant is completed.

[-z:physical]
Enable this flag to replace Zeromus' magic-based damaging attacks with physical attacks (Fight, Dark Wave, Needle/Counter). Zeromus now counters some physical commands instead of magic.

[-z:physmag]
In half the seeds rolled with this flag, Zeromus will have the physical script from <em>-z:physical</em>, and in the other half Zeromus will have the usual magic script.

[-z:chaos]
In each attack phase, Zeromus will have a handful of random attacks (one or two possibly stronger, with a shake). Four attacks are chosen as reactions. The attacks are mostly curated.

[-z:lavosshell]
The three main attack phases are replaced by three random monster scripts that do not automatically progress to another script.

[-z:whichbang]
Each instance of Big Bang is replaced with a (potentially different) spell chosen from a small list, including Big Bang itself.

[-z:phaseshift]
Zeromus has three main phases after the first Big Bang: Virus, Nuke, and Meteo. Enable this flag to shuffle the three attack phases among themselves (the HP thresholds and reactions will not change).

[-z:nonerfs]
Normally in FF4, Zeromus' Big Bang can be nerfed by using magic to trigger a counter-Nuke between the tick that Z sets spell power for Big Bang and the tick when Big Bang goes off. Enable this flag to prevent that happening by implementing chains.

[-z:mustnerf]
Zeromus will now do 9999 damage with Big Bang unless you nerf it (or avoid it in other ways).

[-z:vanillasprite]
Free Enterprise replaces Zeromus' battle sprite with a random sprite. (Its battle behavior and stats are unchanged.) Enable this flag to preserve Zeromus' original battle sprite.

[-tweak:kainmagic] 
Kain gets two spellsets: White (with a new spell Lance replacing Sight) and Black.

[-tweak:edwardheal] 
Edward's Heal command will now use the best of Cure3/Cure2/Cure1 available.

[@wacky]

    <li>Guidingway will introduce the challenge.</li>
    <li>Guidingway will not explain the challenge.</li>
    <li>Wacky challenges are not intended to be balanced, robust, coherent, fair, or bug-free.</li>
