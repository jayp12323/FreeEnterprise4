## Setting up /fork_info
1. update `version.py` to include your repository link
2. update this file to serve as the main entry point for documenting your fork. This file resides at `FreeEnt/server/markdown/main_info.md`
3. As you find you want to expand to have this file serve as an overview, add new markdown files in `FreeEnt/Server/markdown`
4. look at `_example.md` for examples and additional documentation.
